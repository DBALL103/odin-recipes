# odin-recipes
This project involves creating a food recipe website.

For this project I decided to create a food recipes from the three countries which I believe to have the best food, Philippines, Thailand and Korea.

During this project I was able to gain some independance by figuring how things work on my own, as I have previously done other courses however I found that TOP has been the most helpful. At first I also could not grasp onto the contents of Git and command line basics, however through this practical project, I now understand it well, as i was able to experiment and get my hands dirty with some programming.
